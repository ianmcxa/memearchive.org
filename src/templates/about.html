<h1 class="ui heading">About the Meme Archive</h1>
<p>
  The Memearchive is a site dedicated to preserving memes in a transcribed and searchable format. Memes are an important part
  of internet culture, and they are easily lost over time as sites go down or remove old content. Many memes contain text that is
  not searchable making them very difficult to find. Memearchive seeks to fix this problem by storing each meme with a transcription
  of its text. Anyone can submit a meme to the archive, and we hope that you will join us in our efforts to preserve these valuable
  cultural artifacts.
</p>
<h2 class="ui heading">About the Project</h2>
<p>
  Memearchive was created partially because we were having trouble finding memes from years ago, and partially because the amazing
  domain, memearchive.org, was available.
